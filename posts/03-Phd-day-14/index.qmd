## Set back

Ok I did lost around 1500 patients due to no valid outcome. 

In order to include more potential patients, need to fix the order of the workflow. Currently we are at wf3 (2 sCrs), then filter to either death, discharge or transfer. We have removed: unknown, still in hospital, ongoing follow-up and lost follow-up. We might consider be more inclusive by including still in hospital and ongoing follow-up. 

Question: Do we need the outcome variables? What's the research focus for the first paper. Is it just the number of patients with AKI and no AKI?
