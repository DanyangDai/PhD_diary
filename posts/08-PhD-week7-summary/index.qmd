## Not sure how to begin with...

It all started with some very large medium sCr for some patients. The rest of story I decided not to share here. `r emo::ji("ask")`

Of everything that happened, I definitely learnt a lot. 

 - When raising a problem, use terms like "You might be interested in this..."
 - Always make sure that everything is well documented. EVERYTHING. From conversation to code. Meeting minutes, every decision made. 
 - When some code doesn't make senses, always ask 
 - When taking over a project, make sure you check everything even when told not to spend too much time on it. Again, you can trust your boss and team-mate but make sure you understand what they are doing! 
 
## Progress 

Even there are some minor set backs, overall we are still moving forward. After identifying the problem, of course I provided solutions. Under each solution, there are pros and cons. Lucky it doesn't changed the overall results for my project. Re-generated table 1 and compared results. Ethic application is still under going at stage 1. Study protocol draft 1 will be completed by this week. Still worried that I haven't done enough.


## Happy thoughts 

It was really great when Mitch came and visited. I finally feel like it is home again. Everything feel lighter when he's around. Probably because I can actually depend on him when he's around. Not need to do or worry about a lot of stuff myself. 

He also got me this new website [http://blog.daidai.au/](http://blog.daidai.au/) under my own domain.

Really looking forward to going back to Melbourne. `r emo::ji("aeroplane")`


## Brisbane weather 

Still 30 degree everyday in late March...Looking at the monthly average temperature, 6 months out of 12 months have temperature above 26 degrees. Coming from Melbourne where half of the year is winter to Brisbane where half of year is summer really burned out my body. I am having a hard time adjusting to the weather and managing the stress. Hopefully the lily lotus seeds and mung bean soup I made would help me manage the heat.

## Spelling check 

Mitch told me that my blog is full of spelling errors and typos. And when I show him my work emails, they are professional and no grammar mistakes at all. He said "so you can be better." Of course  can! English is my second language and I need to master it. During working hours, I would always double and triple check my English before send it out. Originally I didn't want to do anything about it. This blog is more like a diary to me where I am more relaxed and verbally sounded. Just in case someone don't know who I am and decide to use my blog as the first source to know me, I decide to be more professional. I won't correct the previous blog posts as they are part of me.
