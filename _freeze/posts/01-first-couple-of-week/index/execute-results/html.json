Leaving my friends and family, I packed sixteen boxes and three suitcases to come with me. Not going to lie, I felt emotional and scared (I would have cried writing this down if I wasn't in the office). When I first moved to Melbourne from China, I was seventeen and have no idea what to expect. I was really lucky the whole time being taken care of by my loving homestay family and made lots great friends. This time, I know I will be alone in a unfamiliar city. But I know it is for the greater good, I want to do research and I have been working hard towards this PhD opportunity. This is such a great opportunity for me and I truly cherish this one in a life time opportunity to contribute to science. Lots of PhD friends been telling PhD journey is lonely anyway. Besides, my loving partner is in this PhD journey with me together. Being taken care of for the longest time, I would need to face whatever is coming by myself this time now. At least, need to make some reliable friends otherwise I would have to put my supervisor down as emergency contact lol.\n\n### First week PhD - in the office\n\nStarting in January (RQ1) is not very ideal. All my supervisors have been on leave which is normally the cases for lots of workplaces. HR system setup has been slow as well as lots people on leave. So my first day I didn't really have building access and I need the access to use the bathroom üí© Lucky the centre manager helped me got building access within the first week.\n\nMy first day at work, I met again with my principle supervisor. That's the second time I felt that I belong here now. First time was last year when we first met and he invited me to the department end of year event. Unfortunately he's unwell and I really appreciated that he came in just to meet me despite his illness.\n\nSo yeah, due to no access to the toilet and no supervisor, that's all the office time for PhD week 1. üòé Please be aware, the emoji is using the `emo` package which means that I can only define a group of emoji and which one actually decide to show is random. I thought it would be fun as it would be random and surprising hahaha. üò∂\n\n### First week PhD - work work\n\n-   RQ1 HDR student Induction Went through available supports for HDR students.\n\n-   Zoomed in for a PhD confirmation.\n\n    -   Her opening was interesting and led all the audience right into her topic. She began her presentation by telling us about her grandparents and Chris Hemsworth rising awareness dementia. That was good and effective.\n    -   She presented well about her achievement for her first year PhD. It also inspired me to document my PhD journey. Not only as a diary where I can share my thoughts and feelings but also to record my works.\n    -   She went overtime and there was a lot of detailed information which might not be needed? Not my expertises so not sure about that. But her visualisation could be better.\n\n-   Updated my code and everything broke üò¶. Spent a good five/six hours debugging it. Still didn't work. ‚õΩ\n\n-   Did safety trainings and applied for building access.\n\n-   Wrote a bit of my future career goals after PhD study.\n\n### Made my very first friend in Brisbane\n\nWent out for dinner with her and we really hit it off. Going out again soon. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n",
