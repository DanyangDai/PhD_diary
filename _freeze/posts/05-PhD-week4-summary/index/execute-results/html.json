That research work is a never ending work. You might get a break when you get home but it never ends. And endless tears for me. 😢 \n\n## Updates study cohort and regenerates table 1s and visulaisations \n\nThis week I got to have my very first meeting with all my supervisors. It went really well and we decided on limiting our study cohort to just two countries. \n\nSo for this week, I updated the table 1s and new visualisations for this Omicron paper. If we are happy with the latest results, I can begin to write the first draft for this paper. 👼 \n\nAnd just when I thought that the results look promising, it took a 180 degree turn. It shows contradicted results with the new study cohort compare with last week. ❗ I guess I know what I will be doing this weekend. 🏋 It's always hard when thing doesn't go as plan or exception. \n\n\n## Learning the long road to getting ethic approval and medical data\n\nApparently it will take unknown amount of time to get medical data approved for research studies. I know ethic will take a bit of time like a few months. But I never expected it will take forever as it is something I don't have control over. As a person who over-plan lots of thing, this really hit me hard. 😢 \n\n\n\n## More inductions and social event \n\nAttended FoM induction and it was really helpful for my PhD study. \n\nGet to go to St Lucia and cath up with Hien. It was really good to catch up with Hien. Need a familiar face and someone to talk to. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
