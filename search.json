    "text": "Variable transfomation\nIt bugs me for a long time on the variables I should be including in my regression analysis. The question I want to answer is that whether Omicron patients have a higher chance of developing AKI compare to pre-Omicron variant.\nFirst, the variables such as blood pressure, sCr, age ect. they are not linear. There is a clear lower and upper bond for these variables. There are a few different ways I could handle this.\nTruncated all these variables and bin them. For example, age can be truncated into patients age &lt; 65 and age &gt; 65. Same goes with blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure can be bined from [100,140) to four or five groups. This binning methods is relatively easy to implementation. In R, you can use cut() function to do that. But the downside is that you will lose information on these variables as they are suppose to be continue variables within a certain range but binning will convert them into categorical variables.\nTransformations on the variables. If you have a general understanding of which distribution your data is, use QQ plot to compare your data with the potential distribution you have in mind. If not entirely sure about the data, just plot the histogram of the data to have a look at the distribution. Alternatively, use gladder() function from the describedata package to see which transformation is most suitable. This process require judgement on which transformation to make. It would also increase the difficulty on the interpretations on your regression analysis.\nAcknowledge on the model misspecification and justify the standard errors with sandwich estimator. Use sandwich estimator to generate robust standard errors would allow for unbiased parameters estimated. I think this would be the method I go with for my analysis. ## Variable selection, simultaneous effect and multicollinearity\nVariable selection suggested by my principle supervisor should be driven by the literature which I agree. However, this could create a lot of problems for regression modelling.\nThere are simultaneous effect with a lot of my predictors and outcome. For example, my dependent variable is AKI positive or not which is binary. I want to include death and icu as controls. Because we know from recent research and my data that Omicron has less severe outcome in terms of lower death rate and lower icu rate. So that controlling for these outcome, whether Omicron variant results in a higher rate of AKI incidents. But we also know that AKI patients has a higher death rate and higher icu rate. Maybe I will use simultaneous causal equations for this.\nMulticollinearity is another issue. As pretty much all variables I am including are all somewhat correlated to each other. It’s like common senses that ICU is highly correlated to Death. High White Blood Cell count is associated with inflammation in the body and it can also be correlated with other controls I am including. Still need to work out if this is something I need to worry too much about."

    "text": "Missingness and imputation\nBefore in Econometrics sitting, I don’t think I have ever needed to worry about NAs. They either don’t exits in my data or they are just automatically handled when modelling because they are very little NAs in the data.\nFor my current analysis, out of 9000ish patients records, only 3000ish have completed records. With this amount of missingness in my data, I would need to learn what is the most correct way of dealing with it.\nThe first step is to identify whether the records are missing completely at random (MCAR). This is a very new term for me which I just learnt about reading Regression Modeling Strategies With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic and Ordinal Regression, and Survival Analysis by Frank E. Harrell, Jr. BTW would recommend. It is easy to read. If you decide or know that your missing is completely at random, then not doing anything about them would not introduce bias to your parameter estimates.\nTo examinate the relationship of your missingness, you can do some regression analysis on the missing variables. i.e. the probability of missing comorbidities records is depended on the country. Alternatively, you can use md.pattern from the mice package to check the relationship between your missing values. If you data if relatively small and have a small number of variables you are looking, use naniar package to explore missing values is also great and easy.\nOnce decided that your variables aren’t MCAR, need to decide whether it is ok to impute some variables. For instant, I decided not to impute for death, icu, sex and race. Race has a high missingness at 80% and I don’t think the data have the ability to impute race. Same with sex. Sex only has around 2% of missing and I don’t think you can impute whether the patient is male or female. For death and icu, they all have low missing around 2% and I decide not to impute for them.\nWith mice function, include all variables that you think could help to impute missing values.\nI did worry about how validate my regression analysis is going to be with this amount of imputation and model specification problems. We shall see how it goes."

    "text": "Starting my PhD at UQ\n\nMove from Melbourne to Brisbane\nAfter studying abroad in Melbourne for more than eight years, I moved to Brisbane for my PhD study. Leaving my friends and family, I packed sixteen boxes and three suitcases to come with me. Not going to lie, I felt emotional and scared (I would have cried writing this down if I wasn’t in the office). When I first moved to Melbourne from China, I was seventeen and have no idea what to expect. I was really lucky the whole time being taken care of by my loving homestay family and made lots great friends. This time, I know I will be alone in a unfamiliar city. But I know it is for the greater good, I want to do research and I have been working hard towards this PhD opportunity. This is such a great opportunity for me and I truly cherish this one in a life time opportunity to contribute to science. Lots of PhD friends been telling PhD journey is lonely anyway. Besides, my loving partner is in this PhD journey with me together. Being taken care of for the longest time, I would need to face whatever is coming by myself this time now. At least, need to make some reliable friends otherwise I would have to put my supervisor down as emergency contact lol.\n\n\nFirst week PhD - in the office\nStarting in January (RQ1) is not very ideal. All my supervisors have been on leave which is normally the cases for lots of workplaces. HR system setup has been slow as well as lots people on leave. So my first day I didn’t really have building access and I need the access to use the bathroom 💩 Lucky the centre manager helped me got building access within the first week.\nMy first day at work, I met again with my principle supervisor. That’s the second time I felt that I belong here now. First time was last year when we first met and he invited me to the department end of year event. Unfortunately he’s unwell and I really appreciated that he came in just to meet me despite his illness.\nSo yeah, due to no access to the toilet and no supervisor, that’s all the office time for PhD week 1. 😎 Please be aware, the emoji is using the emo package which means that I can only define a group of emoji and which one actually decide to show is random. I thought it would be fun as it would be random and surprising hahaha. 😶\n\n\nFirst week PhD - work work\n\nRQ1 HDR student Induction Went through available supports for HDR students.\nZoomed in for a PhD confirmation.\n\nHer opening was interesting and led all the audience right into her topic. She began her presentation by telling us about her grandparents and Chris Hemsworth rising awareness dementia. That was good and effective.\nShe presented well about her achievement for her first year PhD. It also inspired me to document my PhD journey. Not only as a diary where I can share my thoughts and feelings but also to record my works.\nShe went overtime and there was a lot of detailed information which might not be needed? Not my expertises so not sure about that. But her visualisation could be better.\n\nUpdated my code and everything broke 😦. Spent a good five/six hours debugging it. Still didn’t work. ⛽\nDid safety trainings and applied for building access.\nWrote a bit of my future career goals after PhD study.\n\n\n\nMade my very first friend in Brisbane\nWent out for dinner with her and we really hit it off. Going out again soon. ❤️"

    "text": "Second week highlight - Debugging\n\nBug 1 - After updating to the lastest patients logic, lost around 1000 patients for the study\n💥 After carefully comparing thousands of lines of code, I was finally able to get the patients outcome add up to the correct amount. However, we originally would have around 2800 patients for our study. That’s not a great start for my PhD, reducing study cohort from 2800 to 1300. I was definitely panicking. I kept telling myself, I need to find out why some of them are not included in the cohort any more.\nLooking through the updated table 1 for another study, I found out that their cohort has a significant decrease (around 2000ish) after changing the logic on outcome. So that means I am expected to have less patients for my study. I was wondering if that is because the patients I have might not have an outcome as they are more recent. After looking into a few lost data points, I found out that is not the case.\nI have already took a deep dive into all the workflow, database, many different scripts trying to identify the problem. Then it hit me, could it be that cohort definition was different? So I went back and checked when the cohort is first being defined and it turns out that the updated code uses date &gt; 2020-01 and date &lt; 2022-10. Ah ha, it actually should have been date &gt;= 2020-01 and date &lt;= 2022-10. After re-defining the variable, I’ve got 2000ish patients for my study which was such a relief. Note for myself, when comparing datetime, should use readr::parse_date(\"2020-01\", \"%Y-%m\"). 🙏\n\n\nBug 2 - Quarto publishing website via github action failed\nWith this blogging website, I was planning to use the github action to prompt the updates automatically when I add a post. That means that this github action would need to able to render and publish. This is the first time I tried using github action. Before for my website, I was using Netlify to deploy and publishing my website. (It’s pretty good and easy. Would recommend.) I was trying the github action that mine-cetinkaya-rundel was using for the github action. It was giving me error messages as below: \nI wasn’t sure about why this is the case so I consulted with the expert - my partner Mitch. He reckon that the this github action was a bit outdated and he recommend using the Quarto recommended Github action. After trying the new github action, I’ve got new error message when trying to publish and deploying. \nI was struggling to find there this _publish.yml is generated and I can’t seem to find any reference about this. I spent a long time researching about this problem but unfortunately failed at this.\nI moved on to using quarto publish gh-pages in terminal.\n\n\nBug 3 - Github authentication failed using terminal\nI am not very familiar using terminal for github let alone facing this authentication error. I first thought that I got my password wrong but after checking it is the correct one. The first suggestion I tried is using Person Access Token (PAT). I generated my token from Github and copied the password. But I don’t know how to use it. I tired usethis package which it seems to be pretty good. It stores the PAT in the renv. How to use it for authentication? I just tried use that as my Github password when terminal asked me to enter password. It doesn’t fix the authentication problem.\nI have to say I tried so many things and a lot of them didn’t work. I also tried a whole bunch stuff that might leads to the success. For mac user, try this:Message “Support for password authentication was removed. Please use a personal access token instead.”.\nAt the end of the day, something worked out for me. I think I would need to be better at documenting errors and solutions. When I am debugging, it’s easy to loss track what you’ve tried. Still figuring out the best practice for debugging workflow."

It was deficiently not something we expected but indeed interesting results.\nFound a paper that is consistent with our study. But as there is a huge gap in between, it is hard to explain the results. As a person who has no medical knowledge, I scan through 194 papers that are related to kidney and Omicron. Picked out 27 papers that is related to my study. Only one paper looked into the different waves of covid and how that affect kidney. I will the the one trying to fill in this gap. The nephrologist on my team said that I am clearly working on an important topic. I guess this is why I choice to do a PhD and why I want to focus on medical research. It is the possibility that my research could be helping people. I would always remind myself that this is the reason why I am here. That is why I moved away from family and friends for a long time to do a PhD. Alongside with the faith and duty that driven me, there are always doubts when things don’t go according to plan. Like Monday I can’t help cried a bit for a stupid reason (too stupid to disclose here hhhh) and questioned myself why am I here.

I have loving partner that encourage me to chase my dreams even it means that we are separated for a while. I have lovely friends that hold my hands when things are hard and guide me through it. Things have always worked out for me. Learning to accept would be my long term lesson. 💪"

I am keeping a meeting minutes for all of our meetings. How to communicate the findings have taken up most of my time. As Emi taught me before, what story do I want to tell and what message do I want to deliver determine what plot I should do. Should I do box plots or histogram to show the distributions when there are extrema values? Should I do visualisations with text labels or should I just do a summary table?

Most of the data we have are observational data. Without conducting carefully designed experiments with controls, it is hard to draw causal inference. But the fact is that, statistics sometimes are ideal. The assumptions for tests and models are ideal for the real world. The truth is that even for observational data, it is difficult to gain access. I remember when I first start working at public health on our CYCLED Study, I was constantly challenging my supervisor about our sample selection as it won’t be representing our cycling population in Melbourne. After three months of recruitment in, I was more relaxed with the sample selection. After the data collection period, I was just happy that we have a good amount of data.\nGreat to know that there are promising career path in academic for me once I complete my PhD study.\n\nR-Ladies Navigating Public Health Careers\n\nGood to know what career in public health looks like"

For the past a few weeks, I have been busy helping out on the LLMIC paper. All my supervisors suggested that working on this project is an easy win for me as I won’t spending much time on this and I will be added as an coauthor on the paper. But it is taking longer than I expected to work on some of the analysis and visualizations. I think I did pretty well with task. And I was given second authorship on the paper.\nHere are some difficult visualization that I never thought I would be able to produce. For example, adding survival table under survival curve. It can be easily achieved with survminer package. But if we want to group the table and the curves with different colors, it might not be as easy as just using the package.\nIf we want to plot two set of survival curves on the same plot, with survminer package, it provides opportunity to do this in the easy way by using gsurvplot_combine(). Same thing can be achieved with survival table.\nThe difficulty I encountered is that the first author of the paper want the curve and table get group with different colors. That being said, simply using ggsurvplot_combine() would not be able to distinguish that as it will only support consistent groups of color. I tired a few different ways by manually supply three color code in a sequence and repeat once so I have one color for two variables. But as there are two sets of survival curves with three variables in each one, it would not recognize the same color code. So I had to gave up on using ggsurvplot_combine().\nThen I discovered package patchwork which allow us to arrange plots or tables easily. In order to meet the requirement, I extracted the data for from the survival curve analysis for both plotting the curves as well as the table. With all the information I need, I am able to create the survival curve and the table separately. Then using patchwork to stacked them together. It was a lot of exploring in to something I haven’t been doing much before. I am actually glad that they pushed me to my limited for me to explore more options. If that’s something people are interested in, I am happy to do a demo on plotting the two survival curves.\n\n\nContinous learning and reading on papers and writting ethic protocal\nAs a person who has always been able to look at the data, play with it, plot it, fit regression and complex model with it, it is difficult for me to think about what I want to do with the data I am asking but have no idea what they look like. Most of the outcomes and objectives are very broad. It is definitely something new and challenging to me. Hopefully with the second revision of the study protocol, we can submit soon so I can move on to other important things.\nWhile re-writing the ethic protocol, I get to read again with all the papers regarding to kidney disease. surprisingly a lot of the medical terms doesn’t scare me anymore and they look familiar. It seems from all my reading that AKI is likely to be the result of inflammation which lead to unbalanced pressure in the kidney tubule area. But isn’t a lot of the disease results of inflammation? I think there are a lot more pathology and etiology for me to study.\n\n\nWent to tropical fruit world 🍅\nIt was a fun trip and get to see a lot of tropical fruit. Like the jackfruit in the featured picture. Tried this miracle berry that changes your taste bud and make lime super sweet!\n\n\nMitch got baby chicks 🐤🐥🐥\nOMG they are so cute! Wish I were there to cuddle them! 🐣\nMitch also set up an live stream of them awwww. So we can watch them from anywhere everywhere!"

    "text": "Variable transfomation\nIt bugs me for a long time on the variables I should be including in my regression analysis. The question I want to answer is that whether Omicron patients have a higher chance of developing AKI compare to pre-Omicron variant.\nFirst, the variables such as blood pressure, sCr, age ect. they are not linear. There is a clear lower and upper bond for these variables. There are a few different ways I could handle this.\nTruncated all these variables and bin them. For example, age can be truncated into patients age &lt; 65 and age &gt; 65. Same goes with blood pressure. Systolic blood pressure can be bined from [100,140) to four or five groups. This binning methods is relatively easy to implementation. In R, you can use cut() function to do that. But the downside is that you will lose information on these variables as they are suppose to be continue variables within a certain range but binning will convert them into categorical variables.\nTransformations on the variables. If you have a general understanding of which distribution your data is, use QQ plot to compare your data with the potential distribution you have in mind. If not entirely sure about the data, just plot the histogram of the data to have a look at the distribution. Alternatively, use gladder() function from the describedata package to see which transformation is most suitable. This process require judgement on which transformation to make. It would also increase the difficulty on the interpretations on your regression analysis.\nAcknowledge on the model misspecification and justify the standard errors with sandwich estimator. Use sandwich estimator to generate robust standard errors would allow for unbiased parameters estimated. I think this would be the method I go with for my analysis. ## Variable selection, simultaneous effect and multicollinearity\nVariable selection suggested by my principle supervisor should be driven by the literature which I agree. However, this could create a lot of problems for regression modelling.\nThere are simultaneous effect with a lot of my predictors and outcome. For example, my dependent variable is AKI positive or not which is binary. I want to include death and icu as controls. Because we know from recent research and my data that Omicron has less severe outcome in terms of lower death rate and lower icu rate. So that controlling for these outcome, whether Omicron variant results in a higher rate of AKI incidents. But we also know that AKI patients has a higher death rate and higher icu rate. Maybe I will use simultaneous causal equations for this.\nMulticollinearity is another issue. As pretty much all variables I am including are all somewhat correlated to each other. It’s like common senses that ICU is highly correlated to Death. High White Blood Cell count is associated with inflammation in the body and it can also be correlated with other controls I am including. Still need to work out if this is something I need to worry too much about."

They either don’t exits in my data or they are just automatically handled when modelling because they are very little NAs in the data.\nFor my current analysis, out of 9000ish patients records, only 3000ish have completed records. With this amount of missingness in my data, I would need to learn what is the most correct way of dealing with it.\nThe first step is to identify whether the records are missing completely at random (MCAR). This is a very new term for me which I just learnt about reading Regression Modeling Strategies With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic and Ordinal Regression, and Survival Analysis by Frank E. Harrell, Jr. BTW would recommend. It is easy to read. If you decide or know that your missing is completely at random, then not doing anything about them would not introduce bias to your parameter estimates.\nTo examinate the relationship of your missingness, you can do some regression analysis on the missing variables. i.e. the probability of missing comorbidities records is depended on the country. Alternatively, you can use md.pattern from the mice package to check the relationship between your missing values. If you data if relatively small and have a small number of variables you are looking, use naniar package to explore missing values is also great and easy.\nOnce decided that your variables aren’t MCAR, need to decide whether it is ok to impute some variables. For instant, I decided not to impute for death, icu, sex and race. Race has a high missingness at 80% and I don’t think the data have the ability to impute race. Same with sex. Sex only has around 2% of missing and I don’t think you can impute whether the patient is male or female. For death and icu, they all have low missing around 2% and I decide not to impute for them.\nWith mice function, include all variables that you think could help to impute missing values.\nI did worry about how validate my regression analysis is going to be with this amount of imputation and model specification problems. We shall see how it goes."

I guess I didn’t expected that it was going to be that time consuming going through hundreds of entries of treatments. Secretly I actually enjoyed it. 🏥 It feels like playing the doctor game when you are young and the dream of becoming a doctor are coming true. That’s what I felt during the first few hours of researching what does each treatment and drug is used for. When the day gets darker, I just so glad I am not a medical doctor. There were only around five hundreds of different treatment and medical records and I was exhausted and forgetful. Can’t image what true MD needs to remember. I mean there are some pattern in the names of drugs. For example, if it ends with “sone”, it’s probably some sort of corticosteroid. If it ends with “CILLIN” or “CLINE”, it’s probably some sort of antibiotic.\n\n\nExcited for the first academic conference ACS & OZCOTS 2023!\nThanks for the support from my principal supervisor and Emi, I am going to the ACS & OZCOTS at the end of this year!

I am happy for him at the same time it was hard to see a warm and comfy study been turned into a man room.\n👯 Our home is now with four people living in it so busier than before.\n😢 I am no longer working for Monash anymore.\n🐟 The fish tank I didn’t really like before are more clean now. So I guess I like it better than before now.\nOh okay. I thought I would have more thing to say about things that changed but I guess everything is kinda same old same old.\n\n\nThings didn’t change\n☂️ Melbourne is still cold and wet.\n🍵 Top tea is still super yummy and the best milk tea place!\n🥧 强记烧腊 is still really good. Same quality and quantity since I first start eating there since undergraduate.\n💑 Friends are still all round. I missed everyone and it was really good to see them.\nI miss the time where we just catch up whenever because we know that we are always around. Now we can only catch up with a strict timeline.\n\n\nhighligts of the trip\nNo.1 My very first Winnie the Pooh birthday cake made my Mitch\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.2 Hot pot with Emi and friends\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.3 Birthday with Mitch at Dandenong rain-forest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.4 Second Pooh bear cake with home grown pumpkin in the background\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.5 Birthday card signed by friends who made it to my party.

    "text": "It took a while to get the very first draft paper ready to share with supervisors. It actually took longer than I expected. Not that I am not working hard on it but sometime it depends on feedback from supervisors. But it is finally happening. I was so excited to share the first draft among my supervisors like a proud mom finally given birth to a child and want to show it off. But learning the entire process of publishing rules and journal selecting make me realize that “given birth” to your manuscript is really just the starting point. To “rise a child” (i.e. getting your paper published in decent journal), there are still a lot to do.\nThe comments I’ve got at this stage are pretty much regarding to grammar and English writing. I am disappointed in myself and thought I should have done better. But also felt bad for my “baby” to be judged with English problems, even everyone is telling me that it is common and don’t feel bad about it. I am getting it polished using all kind of tools available such as Grammarly and ChatGPT. I am aware that I tend to write long and winded sentences. Cutting them down in a concise way is difficult. Because I put a lot of effort into drafting it up, every word means something to me. But on the other hand, it means nothing to the readers or sometime it confuses them.\nThis very first draft of manuscript is currently circling around with my supervisors, the next step would be sending it to other collaborators for internal reviews. After that would be submitting to journals. This long and headaching journey is what my future going to look like. The research work and analysis stage is like “pregnancy” where you collect data, develop methods and doing the analysis work. Writing the paper is like the “given birth” stage where you “push” for your manuscript. Polishing and internal peer reviews are like dress up and educating your manuscript. Then prepare for your “baby” for pre-school (relatively lower ranking journals) or high school (higher ranking journals) or tertiary educations (top ranking journals like Nature/The Lancet). And of course the journal processing fees varies as well. Tertiary education tend to costs more.\nI guess this is all part of PhD and asking myself if I do want this to be the rest of my life. Doing research is fun and rewarding. But getting rejections and criticism is also part of it. It’s all part of the deal. I don’t have any kids at this stage but I could already imagine what is like actually having a kid. You put a lot of 心血 (heart and blood, meaning pouring your heart and sole) into it and it can be sometime rewarding but also disappointing from time to time.\nI hope I could get over of this negative feeling about my manuscript and polishing it to the next level soon."
